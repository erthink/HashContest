Historically HashContest is enhanced superior descendant of the well-known [SMHasher](https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/wiki).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is a placeholder for now.
The source code will be updated when the first semi stable or beta version got ready.
But you are welcome to fill a feature request or append the wishlist.

Current TODO list, briefly:

 1. Separate hash functions source code and the test suite itself;
 2. Add runtime detection of the CPU features;
 3. Redesign hash-function registration API;
 4. Rewrite CMakefiles;
 5. Add verification for tests itself;
 6. Clean and reformat source code;
 7. Import 'mera' library for CPU-ticks measurement;
 8. Add most of available hash-functions;
 9. Provide porcelain and json output;
 10. Refine code to speed up testing;
 11. Add birthday-alike test;
 12. Integration with https://bench.cr.yp.to/supercop.html;
 13. etc...
